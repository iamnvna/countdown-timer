### Project Three - 100DaysofCode
# Countdown Timer
This is a simple program that collects an input *t* from the user and passes it into a function to start a countdown in seconds. 

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import required library(s).
3. Create the function to perform the countdown operation using the time library syntax.
4. Create a variable to collect the time *t* in seconds.
5. Pass the variable to the function, parsed as an integer.
6. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program was my first encounter with the time python library. I intend to explore it further, especially because I didn't get detailed understanding of the code in the function used. 
* I also explored creating functions in this program, and I've gained a better understanding to how functions work.
